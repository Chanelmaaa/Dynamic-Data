Code plan: 

1. Create database with : Days; Activities; Time 

2. Input: form  

3. Output: chart.js (Radar chart) 

Challenge: 

Adding up the multiple inputs of the time spending for the same activity in the same day.

Next steps: 
(Zevenâ€™s advice) 
1.Adding more users; 
2.style the sheet

Update: 
I styled my form and added one more column for the user's name, so the user could see their own report by the name.
